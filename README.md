# Landing_page_htmlcss
TOP Landing page

In this project, I apply what i have learned so far to build a copy of a first page provided by the Odin Project. This is still really beginner stuff, but I am glad with the progress I have made so far. 

I have promised myself to keep going, even if it is just one hour a day, I need to keep practicing untill I one day see the fruit of my labour.
