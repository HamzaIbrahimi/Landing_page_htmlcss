# Landing_page_htmlcss
TOP Landing page

In this project, I apply what i have learned so far to build a copy of a landing page design provided by the Odin Project. This is still really beginner stuff, but I am glad with the progress I have made so far. 

I have promised myself to keep going, even if it is just one hour a day, I need to keep practicing untill I one day see the fruit of my labour. 

One thing i could have done differently was to start out the project from the beginning by first setting up my gethub repo. Unfortunately I got carried away in my trial code folder and just completed the main aspects there.
